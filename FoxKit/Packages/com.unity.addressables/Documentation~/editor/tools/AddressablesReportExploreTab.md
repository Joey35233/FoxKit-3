# The Explore Tab

![](../../images/BuildReportMainView.png)

The Explore Tab contains detailed information about the currently selected build report. You can use the **View By** dropdown to change the way that assets are organized in the build report.

You can sort the Explore View by four different item types:
* AssetBundles: Displays all AssetBundles built as part of the Addressables build. Expanding an AssetBundle displays the assets that bundle contains. This is the default view.
* Assets: Displays all Assets built as part of the Addressables build. Expanding an Asset shows all Assets and Bundles that depend on the expanded asset.
* Labels: Displays all of the Assets built as part of the Addressables build, sorted by the label attached to the Asset. Expanding an asset shows the Assets and Bundles that depend on the expanded asset.
* Groups: Displays all of the AssetBundles built as part of the Addressables build, sorted by which Group generated the bundle. Note that if you use the **Pack Together By Label** or **Pack Separately** group settings, it is possible for multiple AssetBundles to be generated by a single Group.

You can use the search bar in the Build Report window to search within the Explore and [Potential Issues](AddressablesReportPotentialIssuesTab.md) Tabs. This filters all assets in the current view by the text written in the search bar.

Selecting an asset in the Explore Tab will open its information in [The Inspector panel](AddressablesReportInspector.md).
